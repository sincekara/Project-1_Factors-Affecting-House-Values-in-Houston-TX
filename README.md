#Project Outcomes

House’s values in Houston Area are generally higher than average in Harris County. In which, Inner Loop and Southwest are most expensive

#Monthly housing costs 

in Houston Area is cheaper than average, positively affect house values, making a stronger impact in Houston Area. However, the strength of correlation declines over time. 
One exception is Northwest region where the correlation is very weak.

#Household income

Houshold income in Houston area is generally below average compared to Harris County. However, Inner Loop has higher income and Southwest is about equal to Harris County average.
House hold income strongly and positively affects house values. The degree of impact seems stable over time.
